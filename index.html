						Conglomeration is a minimal HTML5 game / mobile application that explores the cycle of tech startups and corporate takeover. The goal is to grow your company by swallowing smaller companies and avoiding bigger ones. Each element on the screen represents a specific company and it's size is determined by a live market capitalization feed. When the user's avatar runs into a smaller company they grow larger. As the user grows larger they become less agile and more susceptible to takeover. If they touch a larger company they grow smaller. The goal of the game is to take over smaller companies at the right pace to be the biggest company on the screen. Conglomeration works well on multi-touch devices or desktop computers.</p>
